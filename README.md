# ProjectBelial
ProjectBelial was a UE4 C++ 3rd Year project (2015) for a couple of students and I. We did this project in roughly 4-5 months to a spec we created ourselves. It was created in Unreal Engine v4.0.8 and is since heavily deprecated.

## Installation
This project will no longer run due to changes with the Unreal 4 Engine, however here are some video URLs of it working way back when...

## Contributing
Feel free to clone this and update it to the newest version of Unreal Engine 4, however do not create a pull request to this repository. This repository is used to show what I did during a university module time-period along with my team-mates.
